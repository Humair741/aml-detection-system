üîç Project Overview
This advanced Anti-Money Laundering (AML) detection system is specifically designed for investment banking environments. Using data science and machine learning techniques, it uncovers sophisticated money laundering schemes through compelling visualizations and narrative-driven insights. The system demonstrates how modern analytics can detect Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML), casino exploitation, and complex financing arrangements.

üéØ Key Features
Multi-Modal Detection Approach: Combines rule-based, anomaly detection, supervised learning, and network analysis techniques
Pattern Recognition: Identifies TBML, casino-investment connections, and complex financing schemes
Network Analysis: Reveals hidden relationships between entities and transactions
Explainable Results: Generates detailed case studies with actionable insights
Interactive Visualizations: Provides comprehensive visual analytics for pattern identification

üöÄ Implementation Plan
The project is divided into several key phases:
Phase 1: Foundation & Setup

Repository creation and initialization
Synthetic data generation for FINTRAC-like financial transactions
Data preparation and initial exploratory analysis

Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering
Comprehensive analysis of transaction patterns
Temporal, geographic, and sector-based analysis
Creation of advanced features for detection models
Generation of synthetic money laundering patterns

Phase 3: Model Development
Implementation of rule-based detection
Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest, LOF, and DBSCAN
Supervised learning with Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN
Network analysis for relationship identification
Ensemble model combining multiple detection techniques

Phase 4: Dashboard Development
Interactive visualizations
Case management interface
Network exploration tools
Anomaly highlighting and explanation
