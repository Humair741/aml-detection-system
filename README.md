🚀 Implementation Plan
The project is divided into several key phases:
Phase 1: Foundation & Setup

Repository creation and initialization
Synthetic data generation for FINTRAC-like financial transactions
Data preparation and initial exploratory analysis

Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering

Comprehensive analysis of transaction patterns
Temporal, geographic, and sector-based analysis
Creation of advanced features for detection models
Generation of synthetic money laundering patterns

Phase 3: Model Development

Implementation of rule-based detection
Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest, LOF, and DBSCAN
Supervised learning with Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN
Network analysis for relationship identification
Ensemble model combining multiple detection techniques

Phase 4: Dashboard Development

Interactive visualizations
Case management interface
Network exploration tools
Anomaly highlighting and explanation

🚦 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook
Required packages (see requirements.txt)

Installation

Clone the repository:

bashgit clone https://github.com/username/aml-detection-system.git
cd aml-detection-system

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Jupyter Notebook:

bashjupyter notebook

Open and run the notebooks in sequence (01 → 05)

📝 Use Cases
The system can be used to:

Detect Suspicious Patterns: Identify transactions that match known money laundering patterns
Discover Anomalies: Flag unusual transaction behaviors that deviate from normal patterns
Analyze Networks: Uncover hidden relationships between entities involved in financial transactions
Generate Insights: Provide actionable intelligence for investigation teams
Visualize Patterns: Create compelling visualizations that tell the story of potential money laundering
